  utter_faq/164:
  - text: Cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents
  utter_faq/165:
  - text: They select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike
      chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids,
      which are similar to meat.
  utter_faq/166:
  - text: This cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure
      that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat
  utter_faq/167:
  - text: The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early
      1980s, it was about seven years, rising to 9.4 years in 1995 and 15.1 years
      in 2018. As a rule of thumg, if you multiply the cat's age by the factor 6 or
      7, you get roughly the equivalent of human age.
  utter_faq/168:
  - text: Keep the plant steadily moist, but do not allow it to sit in water or it
      will drop leaves and may develop root rot
  utter_faq/169:

  utter_faq/170:
  - text: Cats where most likely first tamed in the Middle East and spread from there
      with the propagation of agricultural practices.
  utter_faq/171:
  - text: It is generally considered safe for kittens as young as eight weeks old
      to be spayed or neutered.
  utter_faq/172:
  - text: If you don't want your cats to hunt birds or other animals you can get a
      collar with a bell that warns the prey before the cat can hunt it down. Or keep
      the cat inside if this is an option.
  utter_faq/173:
  - text: How often you need to feed a cat depends from age and health of the cat.
      A kitten needs more food per body weight and should be fed three times a day,
      while for cats older than six months two meals per day should be enough.
  utter_faq/174:
  - text: The weeping fig is originally from Asia but was spread globally as a decorative
      and hedge plant. It was introduced to England by Philip Miller in 1757 and by
      the beginning of the twentieth century it was present in the US, Australia,
      the Caribbean, Sumatra and the Philippines.
  utter_faq/175:
  - text: Babies and toddlers should not be left alone with cats because they don't
      know when they hurt the cat. From school age on children can understand what
      cats need and can slowly begin to take responsibility for a pet.
  utter_faq/176:
  - text: Be nice to the cat and feed her. This should be enough. Cats love everybody
      who is feeding them.
  utter_faq/177:
  - text: The weeping fig needs fertilizer that is rich in nitrogen. Amount of fertilizer
      depends on age and size. In general, give at leat a month during growing season.
  utter_faq/178:
  - text: The weeping fig likes low elevations. It thrives in a sunny place in lots
      of different kind of soils (clay, sand, loam) and with different pH-levels.
      It doesn't take frost very well, so in colder climates it should be grown inside.
  utter_faq/179:
  - text: A cat needs food, shelter and love. If you keep the cat indoors, you might
      also consider adding a litter box and a scratching option.
  utter_faq/180:
  - text: Cats were holy animals in Ancient Egypt. They have a special role in shintoism
      and Chinese folk religion. Although no animals are sacred in Islam, cats are
      revered by muslims.
  utter_faq/181:
  - text: Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter
      sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. A cat can have several litters
      per season.
  utter_faq/182:
  - text: The weeping fig lives from 40 to 150 years.
  utter_faq/183:
  - text: Cats belong to the most popular pets. In Germany, there are more households
      with cats than with dogs. Whether cats are preferred to dogs as pets depends
      from factors like urbanity and economic situation.
  utter_faq/184:
  - text: The pot size should be in proportion to the growth of the plant. If the
      roots get too big for the pot, transfer the plant to a new one that is about
      5 or 6 cm larger than the old one.
  utter_faq/185:
  - text: The roots of the weeping fig grow fast and are very strong. They can even
      lift sidewalks and damage buildings so when growing them outdoors it is best
